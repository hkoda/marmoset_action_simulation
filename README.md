## Overviews of our model
In this model, the dots (marmoset touch location) are generated from the several rules:
- Rule 1. The first dot (touch location) is generated around the screen center with the **large** standard deviation. In other words, this process is the point generations based on the [bivariate Gaussian distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) with the screen center set as *mean* and *large SD*. This aims to simulate the marmoset behaviors to touch the screen widely, **independent** of the previous touching behaviors.
- Rule 2. After the second dots (touch locations), the dot is generated from each of the two sub-rules;
    - Sub-rule 2-1. The dot is generated by the same process of the first dot generation, of the [bivariate Gaussian distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution). The dot is generated **independent** of any previous touching behaviors.  
    - Sub-rule 2-2. The different process consisted of the two steps. First, one of the visible dots (which were the locations the marmoset touched previously) is selected randomly. Then, the next dot is generated around the selected dot with the **small** standard deviations. In other words, this process is the point generations based on the [bivariate Gaussian distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) with the selected dot set as *mean* and *small SD*. This aims to simulate the marmoset behaviors to touch the location near around one of the visible dots screen, **depending** on the previous touching behaviors.
- Rule 3. The maximum number of visible dots is 10.
    - Sub-rule 3-1. From *1-st* dot until the *10-th* dot, the number of visible dots increases up to 10.
    - Sub-rule 3-2. After the *11-th* dots, the *(i-10)-th* dot is replaced with the *i-th* dot. E.g. When the *11-th* dot is generated, *1-st* dot is simultaneously disappeared from the screen.

Following these rules, we generate 200 dots (steps), and then iterate 10000 times of these 200 dots.

## Graphical descriptions of the model
Here I illustrate some examples of the dot generation for quick understanding of our model.
- 1. the example of the *first* dot generation (Rule 1)
- 2. the example of the *second* dot generation (Simplest example of Rule 2 and Rule 3(Sub-rule 3-1))
- 3. the example of the *n-th* dot generation (Generalized example of Rule 2 and Rule 3(Sub-rule 3-2))
### 1. The example of the first dot generations
The first dot is generated from the [bivariate Gaussian distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) with (0,0) as a mean parameter (&mu;<sub>g</sub>) and <img src="GP_cov.png" height="40" align="middle"> as a covariance matrix (&Sigma;<sub>g</sub>). This Gaussian distribution with large standard deviations(SD) is called as "**Global Process (GP)**", hereafter.

The heatmap of probability density of GP. The dot (yellow) is generated from the GP.

### 2. The example of the second dot generation
The next (second) dot is generated from each of GP **OR** the other bivariate Gaussian distribution of the mean parameter (&mu;<sub>l</sub>) set as the previous dot (grey dot in the next fig) and the covariance matrix (&Sigma;<sub>l</sub>) set as <img src="LP_cov.png" height="40" align="middle">. The latter process aims to simulate the marmoset actions of touching the visible dot nearby. This Gaussian distribution with smaller SD is called as "**Local Process (LP)**", hereafter.

The second dot (yellow) is generated from the GP as well as the first dot (black), with the heatmap of the probability density of GP.

The second dot (yellow) is generated from the LP, determined by the first dot (black), with the heatmap of the probability density (red colorations) of LP.


### 3. The example of the n-th dot generations
Similar to the second dot generation, the n-th dot is generated from each of GP **OR** the LP. In the case of LP, the attend dot is chosen from the previous 10 dots (between n-1 th and n-10 th dots), and is set to the mean parameter of LP (&mu;<sub>l</sub>).

The case of GP. The next (n-th) dot (yellow) is generated from the GP, with heatmap of the probability density of GP.

## Flowchart of simulations

- From the *1-st* dot to the *2-nd* dot. &pi; is the probability to choose the GP process.

- From the *(n-1)-th* dot to the *n-th* dot. In the case of the LP proceess, there are two steps, i.e., the attend dot selection and the LP process based on the attend dot .
